# Search for movies

This project is building a movie app to display movies.

## Tools for this project:
Bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
[OMDB API] (http://www.omdbapi.com/) - collects the posters for the movies we're searching for. 
Insomnia to play with the API anc check the JSON received from our requests. 
Bootstrap

### Installation:
This creates a new React app in our directory.
```npx create-react-app movie-app```

This command will install packages which might take a couple of minutes.
It will install react, react-dom, react-scripts with cra-template.

A git repo will be initialized and the template's dependencies will be using npm.

### Commands:
`npm start` - starts the dev server
To view within browser open to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
Page will reload when changes are made and ESLint errors displays within the console. 

`npm run build` - bundles the app into static files for production and optimizes the build for the best performance. After build is minified the filenames include hashes. 

`npm text` - starts the test server in interactive watch mode.

`npm run eject` - removes this tool and copies build dependencies, config files and scripts into the app directory.
THERE'S NO GOING BACK AFTER RUNNING THIS COMMAND!
There's no need to use eject.
